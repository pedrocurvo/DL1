# UvA Deep Learning 1 Assignments, 2024 edition

## Assignment 1

You can find all necessary instructions in **assignment_1.pdf** on Canvas.

We provide to you simple unit tests that can check your implementation. However, be aware that even if all tests are passed, it still doesn't mean that your implementation is fully correct. You can find tests in **unittests.py**.

We also provide a Conda environment you can use to install the necessary Python packages.
In order to use it on Snellius, follow the instructions from our [Snellius guide](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial1/Lisa_Cluster.html).
